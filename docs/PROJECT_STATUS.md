- Anthropic Claude API (Claude 3.5 Sonnet) - for vision & recommendations
- OpenWeatherMap API - for weather data

**Image Processing**:
- Canvas API for client-side resize
- WebP format for optimization
- No background removal (deferred post-MVP)

## Environment Variables

Required in `app/.env.local`:
```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://effebwcunhixinehmozb.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your-anon-key>
```

Optional (for AI features):
```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<your-key>
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=<your-key>
```

## Current State

### What's Working
1. ✅ App runs locally via `npm run dev`
2. ✅ Authentication system (sign up, sign in, sign out)
3. ✅ Wardrobe item upload with client-side image processing
4. ✅ All UI screens render correctly
5. ✅ Database connectivity and CRUD operations
6. ✅ Responsive mobile-first design

### What's Pending
1. ✅ Deploy Edge Functions for AI features - **DONE**
   - ✅ `analyze-clothing` - Deployed to Supabase
   - ✅ `suggest-outfits` - Deployed to Supabase
   - ✅ `get-weather` - Deployed to Supabase

2. ✅ Add Anthropic API key for AI features - **DONE**
3. ✅ Add OpenWeatherMap API key for weather - **DONE**
4. 🐛 **DEBUGGING**: Claude API model access issue
   - Edge Functions deployed but returning "model not found" errors
   - Need to verify correct Claude model name and API tier access
   - Tested models: `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`, `claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620` (both failed)
5. ⏳ Test full photo upload → AI analysis flow - **Blocked by #4**
6. ⏳ Test outfit suggestion generation - **Blocked by #4**

## Next Steps

### Immediate (To Resume AI Debugging)
1. **Check Anthropic Console** (https://console.anthropic.com/)
   - Verify API key tier (free vs paid)
   - Check which models are available to your account
   - Verify sufficient credits

2. **Try Alternative Models**
   - Test with `claude-3-opus-20240229` (most reliable for vision)
   - Or check Anthropic docs for current model names
   - Update Edge Function with working model name

3. **Test Edge Function**
   - Use Supabase Dashboard → Edge Functions → Invoke
   - Use test payload: `{"imageUrl": "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1521572163474-6864f9cf17ab?w=800"}`
   - Verify successful response before testing in app

4. **Resume Full Testing**
   - Once model issue resolved, test wardrobe photo upload
   - Test AI categorization flow
   - Test outfit suggestions

### Short Term Improvements
- Add loading states and error handling UI
- Add toast notifications for user feedback
- Implement outfit preview modal
- Add wardrobe item detail view
- Implement actual event creation in planner

### Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)
- Social login (Google, Apple)
- Background removal for clothing photos
- Advanced filtering and search
- Share outfits with friends
- Calendar integration
- Shopping recommendations
- Wear tracking analytics

## Database Schema Summary

### Tables
1. **profiles** - User profile information
2. **wardrobe_items** - Clothing items with photos and metadata
3. **outfits** - Saved outfit combinations
4. **user_events** - Calendar events for outfit planning

### Storage
- **wardrobe-photos** bucket - User uploaded clothing photos

All tables have Row Level Security (RLS) policies to ensure users can only access their own data.

## Known Issues & Fixes

### Resolved
- ✅ Logo import path errors - Fixed by migrating from `figma:asset` to local assets
- ✅ Logo too small - Increased sizes across all screens
- ✅ Authentication flow - Fully integrated with Supabase Auth

### Open
- None currently

## Design Decisions

1. **PWA over Native** - Faster development, cross-platform compatibility
2. **Supabase over Local-First** - Simpler MVP, easier to scale
3. **Real Claude API** - Better accuracy than mock data
4. **Client-Side Image Resize** - Reduce bandwidth and storage costs
5. **No Background Removal for MVP** - Deferred to reduce complexity
6. **Email/Password Auth First** - Social login deferred post-MVP
